The premise of this project was to take New York's "citibike" data for 2018 and illustrate the data with Tableau. After collecting 2018's data from the "citibike" data site, I cleaned the CSV (comma separated values) and loaded them into a Python Jupyter Notebook.  I then merged the CSVs depending the number of records to one CSV file or a seasonal (summer, winter, fall, spring) CSV file to create my data source for Tableau. Once the data was uploaded to Tableau, I create multiple visualizations to answer the following questions:
____

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?
* By what percentage has total ridership grown? 
* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed? 
* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months? 
* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months? 
* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? 
* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? 
* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? 
* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? 
* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)? 
* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the course of the year? 
* How does the average trip duration change by age? 
* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden? 
* Which Bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection this year? 
* How variable is the utilization by bike ID? 
____
In addition, I also created two static maps: 

* The first "viz" plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start a journey with zip code data overlaid on top. 

* The second "viz" plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
